## My Code Louisville project

#### Website Summary
This main page of this website lists various hobbies and activities. The user is able to click the activities and see a specific page for each hobby or activity. On these pages, the user can scroll through (the titular) WHAT FIVE THINGS that would be helpful to have/own/use in order to get started in that specific hobby or activity. This slideshow links to Amazon products where the user can obtain those products.

#### Disclaimer
This website uses Amazon referral links. If an item is purchased through the user's Amazon session through my website, I will receive a small portion of the value of that purchase. Please consider supporting this project in that way if you are planning on making an Amazon purchase.

#### Hosted Website
The website is also hosted at the below address (however, this may not be the most up-to-date version. The Github version will be the most recent version):
